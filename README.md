# HaircareAI – Hair Fall Analysis using AI/ML

HaircareAI is a web-based AI/ML application that analyzes potential hair fall risk based on user lifestyle, genetic, and hair-care factors, and provides explanations along with basic nutrition and product suggestions.

The project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow integrated with a simple web interface.

## 🚀 Features

- Hair fall risk prediction using a trained ML model  
- Accepts lifestyle, genetic, and hair-care inputs  
- Provides confidence score for predictions  
- Explains possible causes of hair fall  
- Suggests basic nutrition and hair-care products  
- Simple and responsive frontend interface

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User enters details (age, stress level, genetics, nutrition, hair-care habits)
2. Frontend sends data to a Flask API
3. Backend processes input using a trained ML pipeline
4. Model predicts hair fall risk and confidence
5. API returns prediction with explanations and suggestions
